# Cronicle-Jobs

This repository is home to all of my batch jobs that are run on my instance of [Cronicle][0].

I'll do my best to keep them all in this repo as my way to experiment with a sort of mono-repo for my batch jobs.

## Jobs

### GitHub

The first job I've added is a job that stores my latest starred repos in my MongoDB server (`AICMONGO`) hosted on DigitalOcean.
